# Pattern-Recognition---CNN-Implementation

Implement basic CNN architecture (e.g. using AlexNet)
Use the MNIST dataset by loading the dataset in your code. (from tensorflow.keras import datasets)
(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = datasets.mnist.load_data()
Write any data preprocessing code as required including documentation 
Write code to add layer by layer different operations of CNN (Conv, MaxPool, and so on)
Train the model using the appropriate batch size, no. of epochs. 
Evaluate the model on the test set and analyze the accuracy
Plot training vs validation accuracy and loss 
Identify any overfitting and take measures for overfitting (e.g. add dropout layer) and plot training vs testing accuracy and loss
Plot a few correct predicted samples and a few misclassified samples.
